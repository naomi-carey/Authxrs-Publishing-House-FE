### THE AUTHORS PROJECT

Authors is a socially aware and sustainable publishing house supporting suppressed voices worldwide. The project is devoted to people who would like to share their stories who otherwise would not have the opportunity.

The goal is to give non Western voices a platform to be heard from that is not edited or censored in any way by the Western world. These stories are told from real people from all over the globe. Some include:

- Ecuadorian rainforest tribes fighting to keep their land
- Persecution of people with albinism in Africa
- Exploitation of Bangladesh workers by world famous fashion brands

These stories along with many other narratives about violation of basic human rights (which still take place in the XXI century) will be assembled into books.

The frontend environment consists of several areas:

- Tell story form: Which allows a user send messages directly to the authors gmail account (with or without an option to upload a file)
- Contact form: For those who would like to become a part of the authors community and just lend a hand or may have questions.
- Simple subscribe form
- Storybook preorder form: Directly connects to payment form based on stripe payment system.
- Stipe payment checkout: Allows the user to make a purchase and enter their credit card credentials, accepts credit card online payments and sends this information back to the Stipe system. This information can then be used by the merchant to send invoices, receipts, and or refunds to the customer as well as run customized reports.
